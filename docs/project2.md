# GUESS SOURCE OF ARTICLES

The model of the portfolio project should be able to try and identify the source of an article
as one of a reputable news sources (a professional journalist or a news portal)
or whether the origin is an "alternative news" writer, blogger or portal.

It would be trained using articles from various sources : established, professional news services
and "alternative news" sources. Ideally, it should be able to guess with a certain percentage of succes
from what portal the piece of news originated.

The general idea would be the ability to distinguish verified news from alternative news.
Alternatively, it could try and identify the political leanings of the author of the article.

This could be done for English and also for another language.
