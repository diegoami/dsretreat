# CREATING SRT SUBTITLES INTERVALS OF TIMES FROM MUSIC FILES

## What are SRT Files

SRT Files are used to subtitle videos. The SRT format contains a list of intervals of time
when words are being spoken or sung, and the actual text spoken.

For instance below you can see the words that in the associated videos/song are being spoken
between the time intervals 00:00:32,477 --> 00:00:35,020 and 00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,169


4
00:00:32,477 --> 00:00:35,020
Qui dit Ã©tude dit travail,

5
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,169
Qui dit taf te dit les thunes,

## MODEL RECOGNIZING HUMAN VOICES IN SONG

The model produced by the portfolio project should be able to identify continuos portion of songs in which somebody is singing
and produce the approximate intervals of time in form of SRT files, without the actual text

MP3 SONG --> SRT FILE

In this case the output would be

4
00:00:32,477 --> 00:00:35,020
**TEXT1**

5
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,169
**TEXT2**

The language of the text should be not relevant.
To train this model we would use a database of songs along with their respective SRT files.
Producing the actual text would be out of scope of this step

## POSSIBLE EXTENSION - INTEGRATING WITH THE LYRICS

There is much higher availability of song lyrics than of SRT files. A possible extension
would be to take the MP3 song file and the song lyrics as input, and produce the SRT FILE as output

MP3 SONG  ----------\
                     ----> SRT FILE
(RAW) LYRICS -------/

Note that it would be not enough to match lyrics with placeholders in SRT files sequentially,
because lyrics often do not contains the text lines in the correct order or text lines are repeated several times during the song.

## POSSIBLE EXTENSION - INTEGRATE WITH YOUTUBE

Instead of producing the SRT File from a downloaded song, it might be possible to produce the SRT file
from a url pointing to a music video and a lyrics file or even a URL pointing to a page containing the lyrics


YOUTUBE URL--------\
                    ----> SRT FILE
(RAW) LYRICS-------/
